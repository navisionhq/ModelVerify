#  Model Verify

This macOS command line application package demonstrates how to use unit tests to verify that CoreML model is able to make predictions meaningfully. The code is based on [coreml-simple-demo](https://github.com/benjaminirving/coreml-simple-demo).


## Setup


1. Create a MacOS Command Line application in XCode (using default settings).
2. Create a new target for unit tests: File -> New -> Target -> macOS UnitTesting bundle
3. Following this [stackoverflow answer](https://stackoverflow.com/a/29178514/1846021), configure the scheme to make Unit Tests target of original application.
